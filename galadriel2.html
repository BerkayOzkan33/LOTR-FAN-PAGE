                    Galadriel was highly praised for her unrivaled beauty, particularly that of her hair, which was a
                    deep and radiant gold, shot with silver. It was said by the Elves of Tirion to have ensnared the
                    light of the Two Trees of Valinor, Telperion and Laurelin, and possibly to have inspired the
                    creation of the Silmarils by FÃ«anor. Because of her wisdom and power, she had very important roles
                    throughout the history of Middle-earth, especially during her time in Eregion and during the War of
                    the Ring. She had a penchant for dressing in the purest white. <br><br><br>
                    "In place of a Dark Lord you would have a Queen! Not dark but beautiful and terrible as the Dawn!
                    Treacherous as the Seas! Stronger than the foundations of the Earth! All shall love me and despair!"
