                    and bushy eyebrows that stuck out beyond the brim of his hat."<br><br>Gandalf was one of the five
                    Istari sent to Middle-earth by the Valar in the Third Age. In Valinor he was known as Olórin.
                    Gandalf was instrumental in bringing about the demise of Sauron in T.A. 3019, chiefly by encouraging
                    others and dispensing his wisdom at pivotal times. He was originally robed in grey, and second to
                    Saruman in the Order of Wizards. After his fall in Moria, Gandalf returned to Middle-earth as head
                    of the Order, robed in white.<br><br>
                    Originally called Olórin. He was accounted as the wisest of the Maiar. </p>
