                <p>He was created by Ilúvatar before the Music of the Ainur, and was at the beginning of Time amongst
                    the Ainur who entered into Eä. In his "youth" he became one of the Maiar who served Manwë, Varda,
                    Irmo, and Nienna. He was associated with light and fire, much like Varda, yet his ways often took
                    him to Nienna, from whom he learned pity and patience.
                    <br>
                    He loved the Elves, but walked unseen amongthem, or wore the guise of an Elf, and sent them fair
                    visions in their hearts that made them wiser.
                    Throughout his life he followed the example of Nienna, talking pity on the sorrows of the Children
                    of Ilúvatar and drawing those who listened to him out of despair.
                    <br><br>
                    "I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. The dark fire will not avail you,
                    flame of Udûn!"
