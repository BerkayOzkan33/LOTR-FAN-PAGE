                <p>Renowned student of the Vala Aulë, and most trusted lieutenant of Morgoth in the First Age. After
                    Morgoth's ousting by the Valar, Sauron became the second Dark Lord and sought to conquer
                    Middle-earth through guileful trickery, with the Rings of Power or with overwhelming legions.
                    At the end of the Second Age, Sauron caused the downfall of Númenor, and was then defeated in Mordor
                    in the War of the Last Alliance of Elves and Men united under Gil-galad and Elendil. In the final
                    battle, Isildur managed to cut the One Ring from him, dismantling his corporeal form and ridding
                    much of his power. After centuries lying dormant, rebuilding strength and stirring awake evil
                    things, Sauron returned to power late in the Third Age.
                    <br> "I have been awake
                    since
                    before the breaking of the first silence. In that time... I have had many names.
