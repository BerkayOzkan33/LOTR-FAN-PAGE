                    The Wizards were forbidden, however, from matching the Dark Lord in power and fear.

                    Curumo was one of those who volunteered, whereas the last one, Olórin, (later known as "Gandalf")
                    was commanded by Manwë to go too. It was from this point that Curumo began to be jealous of Olórin,
                    due to Varda's decision to send Olórin not as the third Istari, but as the second. He also was
                    charged to take Aiwendil (later called "Radagast") to please Yavanna, which Curumo did not wish to
                    do, and this led to contempt for the latter Wizard. The others who were chosen were Alatar and
                    Pallando (the Blue Wizards). Curumo then was appointed overall leader of the group.
