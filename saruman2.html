                    Saruman was originally one of the powerful Maiar of Aulë the Smith named Curumo (later in Sindarin,
                    Curunír).[1] As Tarindor, Saruman was among the Five Guardians chosen to protect the newly-awakened
                    Elves from the evils of Melkor and his lieutenant, Sauron.

                    In Valinor, the land of the Valar, a council was called by Manwë, Eru's regent, shortly after
                    Sauron's defeat by the Last Alliance of Elves and Men. Though the Dark Lord was overthrown, he had
                    not been effectively vanquished and his Shadow began to fall upon Middle-earth a second time. It was
                    decided to send five emissaries to Middle-earth. These should be "mighty, peers of Sauron, yet forgo
                    might, and clothe themselves in flesh," as they were intended to help Men and Elves unite against
                    Sauron.
