                <p>"Now Sauron's lust and pride increased, until he knew no bounds, and he determined to make himself
                    master of all things in Middle-earth, and to destroy the Elves, and to compass if he might, the
                    downfall of NÃºmenor. He brooked no freedom nor any rivalry, and he named himself Lord of the Earth.
                    A mask he still could wear so that if he wished he might deceive the eyes of Men, seeming to them
                    wise and fair. But he ruled rather by force and fear, if they might avail; and those who perceived
                    his shadow spreading over the world called him the Dark Lord and named him the Enemy; and he
                    gathered under his government all the evil things of the days of Morgoth that remained on earth or
                    beneath it. <br>Sauron,the eponymous Lord of the Rings, was the greatest subversive Maia, maker of the
                    One Ring.</p>
