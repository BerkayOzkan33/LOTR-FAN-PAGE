                <p>"Upon it sat a shape, black-mantled, huge and threatening. A crown of steel he bore, but between rim
                    and robe naught was there to see, save only a deadly gleam of eyes: the Lord of the Nazgûl... now he
                    was come again, bringing ruin, turning hope to despair, and victory to death. A great black mace he
                    wielded. " <br><br>The Witch-king of Angmar, or Lord of the Nazgûl, was the leader of the Nazgûl
                    and Sauron's second-in-command during the Second and Third Ages of Middle-earth.
                    After Sauron's defeat by the Last Alliance, the Witch-king eventually reappeared in the Third Age's
                    14th century to found the evil realm of Angmar, where he gained his infamous epithet and ruled for
                    almost seven centuries until the three successor states of Arnor were finally conquered. <br> <br>
