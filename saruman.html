                <p>"Once he was as great as his fame made him. His knowledge was deep, his thought was subtle, and his
                    hands marvelously skilled; and he had a power over the minds of others. The wise he could persuade,
                    and the smaller folk he could daunt. That power he certainly still keeps. There are not many in
                    Middle-earth that I should say were safe, if they were left alone to talk with him, even now when he
                    has suffered a defeat. Gandalf, Elrond, and Galadriel, perhaps, now that his wickedness has been
                    laid bare, but very few others."<br><br>He is leader of the Istari, wizards sent to Middle-earth in
                    human form by the godlike Valar to challenge Sauron, but eventually he desires Sauron's power for
                    himself and tries to take over Middle-earth by force from
                    his base at Isengard.</p>
